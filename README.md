## Example Workflow

1. User submits an IT issue:
  > "I changed my password and now my VPN is not connecting."

2. Backend sends the ticket to the AI analysis service

3. AI gereates:
  - Caregory: Network
  - Summary: VPN connectivity issue detected
  - Recommended steps:
    - Clear saved VPN client
    - Verify account permissions

4. Ticket is stored in the database and displayed on the dashboard.

## Future Improvements

- Replace rule-based AI analysis with Claude API
- Add authentication
- Add technician/user roles
- Add AI chatbot for troubleshooting
- Add ticket history and analytics

## Running locally
